= nifi-webhook-authorizer

== Purpose
The purpose of this is to serve as a generic webhook authorizer for Apache NiFi in order to be able to secure NiFi with for example the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent] or similar tools.

== Installation
The jar file needs to be provided on the CLASSPATH of NiFi. The easiest way to achieve this is to copy it to the `lib` directory in the install folder (not recommended to do this, but the easiest way).

== Configuration
The authorizer can be configured in the authorizer.xml file of NiFis configuration directory.

----
<authorizer>
    <identifier>webhook-authorizer</identifier>
    <class>tech.stackable.nifi.WebhookAuthorizer</class>
    <property name="Authorizaten Endpoint URL">http://localhost:8000</property>
</authorizer>
----

To make NiFi use this authorizer, it has to be referred to by name from the `nifi.properties` file:

----
nifi.security.user.authorizer=webhook-authorizer
----

Additionally an identity provider has to be configured, but this is outside the scope of this project.
